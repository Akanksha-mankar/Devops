    What is Terraform, and how does it differ from other infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools?
    Explain the core components of Terraform, such as providers, resources, and modules.
Ans :- terraform is an open source "Infrastructure as a code " created by Hashicrop. It allow a user to  define and provision infrastructure using high level configuration languag know  as hcl. Terraform supports a wide range of provider including major cloud platform like aws azure google cloud and on premisse infrastructur.
provider:- it is an plugins that define and manages the terraform resource bassically if we want to  create the infrastructure on aws the use provider as aws.
Resources:- resource is a specific componet of infrastruct for  example  if our provider as aws the we want to create a vpc or ec2 instance as a resource.
modules :- 


A DevOps Engineer manually created infrastructure on AWS, and now there is a requirement to use Terraform to manage it. How would you import these resources in Terraform code?
Ans :-
    Accroding to thid question we are creatig the infrstructure mannully now they want this infrastructure to be manage throught terraform. considerwe are creating the infrastructure on aws maullay and for an infrastructure to be managed through terraform it has to be present inside the state file . we will start creating the configuration first it will create the code which is going to be a resource block for this perticlul instance specifying the instance type also ami used and all theother things once we write the code this is to be inside the state file  we will run the the terraform import command
    1. Bassically we are write the configuration file fot thee  resources we want to manage.
    2. Then run terraform import command foreach resource, specifiying the resource type and its uniqueid in aws
  For example :- terraform import aws_instance.example i-
  Reapte the process for each resource you want to managethrought terraform  


  You have multiple environments - dev, stage, prod for your application and you want to use the same code for all of these environment. How can you do that?
Ans :- 
    To achieve this we have actually two different approches the first is terraform modules it is a block of code or the code template for infrastructure components. and you define them once, and then you can use them with the different configuration for various environments by passing in different parameters. 
    second is used the worksapce using worksapce we will have different state file for different  enviroment using the same code. Bassically it provide a way to manage separate state file  for the same state of configuration file of   


                                                         
                                                         
                                                         
What is the Terraform state file, and why is it important?
Ans:-
    Terraform state file is JSON or the binery file that stores the current state of managed infrstucture.  It is  like a blue print that stores the information about the infrastructure you manage.it is  crucial because terraform understand what already set up the and what change to be made.By comparing the desire state setup with the current one in state file.



Explain the concept of "Terraform Modules" and their benefits in managing reusable infrastructure code.
Ans :- 
    Terraform moudle are the way to encapsulate and resuse code in terraform , infrastructure as a code.
A moudle in Terrafom like a container for multiple resource that are use together
